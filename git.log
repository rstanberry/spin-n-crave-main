# git.log

Repository: spin-n-crave-main
Branch: main
Generated: 2025-09-30

Note: The repository currently has no commits. `git log` returned an error: "your current branch 'main' does not have any commits yet".

Next steps you might take:
- Make an initial commit (e.g., `git add . && git commit -m "chore: initial commit"`) to populate this log.
- Re-run the tool that generates this file to capture recent commits.

If you'd like, I can create an initial commit for you with a default message and then regenerate `git.log` with actual commit entries. Reply with "create initial commit" to proceed.
